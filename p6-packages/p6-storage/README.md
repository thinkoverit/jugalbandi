# JB Storage

This package takes care of the storage management. It does the storage operations like reading, writing, listing, deleting, etc. The Storage class is a boilerplate class that can be extended to create a new storage class. Currently Google Storage class and Local Storage class are implemented by extending the Storage class. The Storage class is used in various packages such as:

- The DocumentCollection class is a wrapper class that uses the Storage class to perform the storage operations.
- The Library class is another wrapper class that uses the Storage class to perform the storage operations.
